analysis of emotion data using bayesian methods

The goals of these analyses were to use Bayesian methods to analyze a large dataset of emotion data collected from the Human Connectome Project.

Analyses include:
- Exploration of distributions (i.e., Gaussian, poisson, 0-inflated poisson, negative-binomial, 0-inflated negative binomial)
- Bayesian regression
- Bayesian hierarchical models
- Bayesian Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- Comparisons of noninformative, weakly informative, and informative priors
- Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE)

Primary packages used: RSTANARM, BRMS, INLA
